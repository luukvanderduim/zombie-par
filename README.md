  Parallel bridge riddle solver in Rust

This program solves the TED-ed bridge riddle by Alex Gendler:

Besides solving the puzzle it more so serves as test bed-project to learn some Rust.

The solver uses a naive depth-first backtracker to find a solution.
It does so by:
  Keeping track of states of 'Which laboratory staff member is on which side of the bridge'.
  Depending on where we are in the cross-sequence, it will either
  - generate a list of possible duos who could cross or
  - pick a lab-staff member to bring back the lantern.
When a sequence ends, meaning the current crossing structure is fully occupied,
the current structucture will compare itself with the fastest known crossing structure
and will update the fastest if the current crossing was even more efficient.

The Rayon crate is used to parallelize the search by using the 'parallel iterator'.
However, because rayon does some sophistaced accounting, work-stealing load balancing,
the parallel searching is actually slower than the single threaded version.

During its search it will print the most efficient solution up until that point in time
and show how many iterations it took before it found that solution.
